##### TODO:

- fix gradient colors: match primary and accent color
- make accent color not transparent
- make expander border also gradient?
- spice up header: maybe some cool animation, and better link styling
- it would be cool to have my resume automatically export as pdf and commit to here
- pages I could add: photo gallery, recipie book, sailing log, blog
- utterences.es for comments on select pages?
- probably want to make each project its own page... not sure yet though. probably once i have enough projects it will be too much to load on one page
